# Forms
It's important to note that in idk-lang, every syntactically valid
construct is "known" as a _form_. There are two types of forms,
there are _statements_ and there are _expressions_. Statements
do not return a value. Expressions return a value.

## Assignment & Blocks
Assignment comes in two flavors... blah blah blah


```python
from titty import bitty

def function(*args, **kwargs):
  for i in range([1,2,3]):
    print(i + 1 and True or False)
```
