        Functions 1
      </div>
      Somewhere in my senior year of high school, two friends and I were
      wondering how one could write <ezb-code>min(x,y)</ezb-code> using
      only binary arithmetic, (non-comparison) operations, and elementary
      functions. The main thing we wanted to avoid was a function defined
      in a piecewise manner using conditionals. It took us a little while
      to come up with something, but eventually we got this:

      $$ \min(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{2} - \frac{\lvert x - y \rvert}{2} $$

      This first part of this function finds the midpoint between $x$ and $y$.
      Then, we travel half the distance between $x$ and $y$ toward $-\infty$,
      thus arriving at the smaller of the two numbers. It's pretty clear that
      <ezb-code>max(x,y)</ezb-code> can be achieved by travelling toward
      $\infty$ instead of toward $-\infty$, like so:

      $$ \max(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{2} + \frac{\lvert x - y \rvert}{2} $$

      Curious to perform this &ldquo;mathematical translation&rdquo; on other
      functions commonly used in programing, we wondered how this could be done
      for equality, <ezb-code>x == y</ezb-code>.  Since we wanted to stick to
      functions on the reals, we opted for <ezb-code>true</ezb-code> being $1$, and
      <ezb-code>false</ezb-code> being $0$. Here's what one of us came up with,

      $$ \text{eq}(x, y) = 1 - \left\lceil \frac{\lvert x - y \rvert}{\lvert x - y \rvert + 1} \right\rceil $$

      Using the celing function might seem like &ldquo;cheating&rdquo;, but
      it's important to remember that we were mostly trying to sidestep
      functions defined in a piecewise/pattern-matching fashion. Thus, this
      one-line arithmetic definition met our needs.

      We kept going. Another useful function is <ezb-code>sign(x)</ezb-code>,
      also known as <ezb-code>signum(x)</ezb-code>, that returns $-1$ if $x$ is
      negative, $1$ if $x$ is positive, and $0$ if $x$ is $0$. Here's what we
      came up with,

      $$ \text{sign}(x) = \left\lfloor \frac{x}{\lvert x \rvert + 1} \right\rfloor +
         \left\lceil \frac{x}{\lvert x \rvert + 1} \right\rceil $$

      Now, what's the fun in doing all of this? Well, for me it was the fact
      that in programming, arguments to a function (even as numbers) are
      data, stored sequentially in memory. This mindset allows for easier
      conceptualization of some operations over others. For example, how would
      you write some code to reverse a number? Well, if the number was stored
      in base 10 in memory, and not in binary, you could just copy the data
      but in reverse order. Now, how would you write a <i>math function</i> to
      reverse an integer? When I was first working on this stuff in, the idea
      of doing this blew my mind. Control flow, time and space complexity, a
      sequence of instructions, all of that was gone when writing using just
      arithmetic operations.
