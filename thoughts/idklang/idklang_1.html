      <h1> Preface </h1>
      A lot of programmers at some point end up wanting to write their own
      language. As unlikely as it may be, they think that they have better
      ideas than anyone else has ever had. Now, it's my turn.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have had a single project like this one before. I called it
      <a href="https://github.com/enricozb/myth-lang">myth</a> and it was
      really nothing more than a incomplete toy language. I quickly learned
      that the best way to develop a language would be: come up with a
      satisfactory language specification, freeze it, then implement it. Upon
      successful implementation, one can revise the language spec. The main
      point here is, implementation and changing the language spec should never
      be happening simultaneously.
      <br>
      <br>
      Before really getting into this, I also tried to think about why
      a language like this doesn't exist yet. Maybe there's something I'm
      missing (likely) or maybe there's something everyone else is missing
      (unlikely). For example,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">Golang</a>
      was co-developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>,
      who designed and implemented the <i>original</i> Unix operating system.
      This guy has seen it all, and he was there since the beginning.
      He was given a chance to really change how things were done, what kind
      of bugs people would encounter, and yet, Golang still has pointers...
      My language won't have pointers, or any notion of memory management.
      So, either I am missing something huge (likely) or Ken has gone
      completely insane (unlikely).

      <h1> Enter idk-lang </h1>
      Currently, I have no idea what to call this language, so I've
      temporarily named it idk-lang. Some key features would be, syntax
      as <i>readable</i> and as <i>writable</i> as Python's, static typing,
      high support for functional programming features, something as close
      to duck typing as possible in a strict statically typed language.
      Another key aspect of the language would be that the few rules that
      govern it are strict and highly orthogonal.

      operators.
