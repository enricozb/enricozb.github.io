          The first time I was in love, I don't think I spent any time questioning whether or not I actually was.
          Looking back, I think I thought I was but — in retrospect — I was probably too <a href="https://quotecatalog.com/quote/mitch-hedberg-one-time-this-Ra3Ejk7">young</a>
          to really know the weight of something like that. The second time I <i>could</i> have been in love,
          I <i>was</i> more introspective, and had more reservations. Not dissimilar to how
          one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_judgment">withholds judgement</a>
          as they mature. The third time, however, I was certain.

          It was a period of marked harmony, growth, freedom, and enjoyment. I learned so much
          about patience, humility, respect, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)">serenity</a>.
          It was so <i>good</i>. It was the healthiest addiction, and I really miss it.
