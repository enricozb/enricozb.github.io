          The first time I thought I was in love, I wasn't too introspective about it. I think
          I thought I was but — in retrospect — I was probably too young to really know the
          weight of of something like that. The second time I <i>could</i> have been in love,
          I <i>was</i> more introspective, and had more doubts. Not dissimilar to how one withholds
          judgement as they mature. The third time, however, I was certain.

          It was a period of marked harmony, growth, peace of mind, and enjoyment. It was so <i>good</i>.
          It was the healthiest addiction, and I really miss it.
