          I haven't been this irritable in a while. Maybe spreading myself so thin was a mistake.
        </p>

          I feel unfulfilled. I feel guilty. I feel like I'm eating myself. Yet part of me knows
          or at least believes that I'm capable.

          I feel a candle being burnt at both ends, but it's not giving a bright light.

          Why can't I focus? My days are ill-spent, and yet I feel like I have no time at all.
          My mind is constantly occupied with things I would rather it not be. Things I do not
          care about. I'm not learning; I'm not growing; I am throwing away my time.

          What am I working toward?

        <p>
          There's an internal lack of honesty. I'm not even letting my mind wander. I am
          quieting it.

          When I get home, I don't want to program anymore. I feel like I'm trading my patience for money.
