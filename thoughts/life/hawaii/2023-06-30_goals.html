          I quit my job a little over 6 months ago. I don't have as much to show for it as
          I'd like to. There are things I want to do, but that I haven't done. There are
          projects I didn't think I would do but I did. In retrospect I think some part of
          me was just "hoping" that I would have created out some financially stable and
          self-sufficient project.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to quitting, I didn't really have any projects in mind, but I didn't worry
          about it as I was pretty confident some idea would come along.
        </p>

          For the first three months or so of the year I was travelling. Despite having
          a good amount of savings from work, I felt afraid of losing or wasting too much
          money. Is it greedy to want to be financially secure and <i>not</i> want to work?
          I feel <i>lazy</i>. Even right now I'm writing this because of some mixture of
          laziness to do some "real work" and the "desire" to publish another blog post
          along with some pictures.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have so many entries across my different journalling mechanisms (paper,
          reMarkable, markdown, this website) of my complaining (and almost whining) about
          my lack of progress/determination/use of time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I do think, however, that I have more of a goal than I have had in a long time.
          After travelling throughout Europe, spending some time in NYC and New Jersey, I
          think I want to find a way to have a place here in Hawaii.
        </p>

        <p>
          And immediately after writing it down I wonder, "is it true?".
        </p>

        <p>
          I do have <i>an</i> idea, that I think <i>could</i> make some money, and could
          cover my costs and more. I just need to sit down and do it. Waiting will just
          make it worse.
        </p>
