          I've been back for almost a month now, but it doesn't feel like what it felt before.
          It feels like I haven't come back yet.
        </p>

          I think back to not knowing when I'd leave, being left to myself; it gave me peace. I
          feel like I'm counting my days, and that takes a toll on the experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I went surfing at night recently. That reminded me of what it felt like. The healthiest
          mix of fear and wonder. I need to make these days count, but not at the expense of the
          days themselves. I won't have this time again, and I need to protect it if I can, and
          <i>I can</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having days to yourself is important, but having weeks or months is not often an easy ask
          or even possible.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          I can't wait to <i>feel</i> tumbled again, to get lost in it, to have it take me.
