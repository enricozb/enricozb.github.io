          Very fortunately, I was able to squeeze in a visit back to Oahu for a few weeks before
          moving permanently to Netherlands.

          While I've definitely been missing it a lot, I have missed it less than I thought I
          would. I got to surf a bit in NYC, and I really enjoyed the pace of life while
          abroad searching for housing. It felt a bit like living life slowly again.

          Biking around in Amsterdam has been so much fun. So many things feel closer on the
          bike, and I (so far) haven't minded the shitty weather much. Biking in the rain is
          another way to be in "nature", similar to swimming in the ocean. Even biked in NYC
          a bit the past few days, since I missed it as a way to get around.

          I haven't made as much progress as I had hoped with <a href="sievvy.com">sievvy</a>,
          but something is slowly coming along. I found <a href="socket.dev">socket.dev</a>
          recently, which got my hopes a bit down. A pretty fleshed out equivalent product.
          I just have to keep it very simple and very cheap, no frills.

          I've recently been a bit upset at the difficulty of finding a job/role I would enjoy.
          I'm trying to find things more academically oriented, especially if they could involve

          I'm ready to get back in. Even if for just a little bit.
