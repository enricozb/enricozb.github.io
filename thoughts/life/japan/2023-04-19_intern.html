          This was originally written around August 17th, 2018, in a stream of consciousness
          manner, on my last day in the office. I've edited it extensively to be a little more
          presentable, and a little less ungrateful. When it was originally written it was in
          present tense, but since the past is in the past, I (future I, relative to past I)
          wrote it in past tense.

          I had the chance to <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/calendar/japan-internship-program-information-seminar-86046">work in Japan</a>
          for the summer of 2018. It was a mixture of befuddlement and wonder.
          I don't understand how these people come into work. I truly don't. I'm
          looking around the office right now and some people seem interested in
          what they're doing, but a lot of them just seem to stare into space with
          a face of hopelessness. A face of just, waiting out their existence. I guess
          I'm kind of doing the same thing.
        </p>

        <h1>The First Day</h1>

        <p>
          Prior to my arrival, I was given a rough idea of what I would be working on,
          and had a brief email exchange with my future boss. However, I was clearly
          not prepared for what I could only describe as the most eccentric development
          and workplace environment I have ever experienced.
        </p>

        <p>
          I woke up at 6 am to have enough time to eat the dorm breakfast downstairs
          and catch the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/F6LEiHK1U541rfTa6">7 am train to
          head to the office</a>. The route was two trains followed by a 15 minute
          walk to the office. Luckily, I had a friend from college that was also
          doing this internship program with me, so I was not alone. When we got to
          the office, we met an HR representative that we were communicating with
          over email.  Before we could meet our respective bosses, we had to first
          change into our Mitsubishi uniforms. Then she mentioned that we actually
          had to go meet the man in charge of the building we would be working in.
        </p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="/img/thoughts/life/japan/2023-04-19_2.jpeg">
        </div>

        <p>
          This meeting with the floor boss was more of a diplomatic gesture than anything
          else. His office was in the spatial center of the building, on the central floor,
          in the center of the floor. As we walked up to this office, we could see that
          it was guarded by a large set of wooden double doors. We paused before
          the doors and she briefed us on what would follow. We were to bow as we
          said our greetings, say that Caltech was grateful to have this relationship
          with Mitsubishi, and then exit.  The two doors opened simultaneously as if
          a throne hid behind them, we said our greetings, the floor boss said his,
          and then the doors closed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The HR rep then gave us our "safety" manuals, which I discuss later in this post,
          and sent us to our floors. After finally meeting my boss, he gave me a rundown
          of my desk and some instructions on setting up my company email account. All of
          a sudden, a <i>bell</i> rings. I thought this was a fire alarm or something, but
          no one moved. It was 8:30 am. <i>Work has begun</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I could not believe they had bells at work, just like we do in US schools. After
          a handful of hours, another bell rang at 12:00. Lunchtime.
        </p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="/img/thoughts/life/japan/2023-04-19_1.jpeg">
        </div>

        <p>
          The lunches were actually really nice. I enjoyed not being able to recognize what
          I was eating, and adventuring on each of the little sections of the bento. Throughout
          my entire time there, almost all of the unidentifiable (to me) compartments were
          delicious.
        </p>

        <p>
          About five minutes into lunchtime, the ceiling lights turned off. I see many of the
          workers on my floor get out pillows, place them on their desks, and then just pass out.
          I thought this was a little weird, but maybe it's cool that they've normalized a
          workplace naptime. Then, around 12:25 or so a much softer bell jingle wakes everyone up.
        </p>

        <p>
          At 3:30 pm, yet another bell rang, and everyone stands up at their desks. Me, obviously being
          a foreigner and not speaking Japanese that well, I did the same. Then
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwYVSWrk-JE">some weird music</a> comes
          onto the PA system and starts yelling a bunch of things that I could not understand. Everyone
          on my floor, throws their arms into the air. Okay I guess I'm doing that now. Followed
          by stretches, and some mobility exercies, jumping jacks, etc. Why did no one tell me about this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then at 5:00 pm, another bell rang, and that was my cue to go home. I was explicitly forbidden
          from doing any overtime, so home I went.
        </p>

        <h1>Things I had problems with</h1>

        <p>
          No headphones or music of any kind allowed while in the office.
          Everything is gray. Punctuality is more highly valued than output. That is, I felt
          like if I had worked twice as fast as the guy next to me, but showed up 30 minutes late
          every day, I would be fired.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of the time, If I was prohibited from doing something,
          it was nominally for security or safety purposes. I wasn't sure if this was a
          mistranslation of "safety", because there were some bizarre rules:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Required to wear <i>soft</i> hats when walking outside.</li>
          <li>
            Several <i>useful</i> websites are blocked, such as
            <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org">PyPI</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            No listening to music and walking outside. The campus guards chased my coworker
            down walking with even just one earbud in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our computers' USB ports have stickers over them to prevent people from inserting
            malicous drives into them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While some of these might make some sense (like blocking websites), what I didn't
          understand was how unserious it felt. For example, I was given a Raspberry Pi as
          part of my project, which had to be connected to the internet. The service I had
          to interface with was on a blocked IP, so my boss just grabbed the blue ethernet
          cable beneath the desk, as opposed to the gray one, and plugged it in. Apparently
          the blue cables were unrestricted, and the gray cables went through the neutered
          intranet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another incidence of this half-assed security infrastructure was a phishing email
          that I had gotten on my work email during my first week. I was confused how this
          was even possible since I hadn't posted this email anywhere, but I didn't think
          much about it. Especially so because I was very curious in seeing how well-crafted
          these Japanese phishing emails were. Upon clicking one of the links in the email,
          a page with many large red characters came up, and it was clearly some internal
          Mitsubishi page. After attempting to read it and translate it, it seemed that this
          was an internal phishing test to see who would fall for it. The page said I was
          supposed to report to my boss, but I decided not to since I could claim not
          being able to read the Japanese. My boss, however, never mentioned it to me,
          and I never got any further emails about it again. How could they run an internal
          phishing test like this and <i>not</i> follow up with the people that fell for it?
        </p>

        <p>
          We were given a safety and security manual, that I have unfortunately since
          thrown out, that had some absurd sections:
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          It is not improbable that a colleague in the workplace may suddenly die,
          leaving permanent scars on family member and the workplace.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          Unsafe Behavior: Example No. 10: Do not work long hours while sitting with
          your legs crossed... Your legs may fall asleep, and if you force yourself
          to walk under such condition, you may fall.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          When discarding purchased items, destroy the item physically with a hammer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps sensibly, I don't have admin rights to my windows computer. (I had to
          get permission to install Chrome, Sublime Text, etc). There was an incident
          where I needed to install some software to flash a piece of hardware. The
          entire hierarchy of bosses were at work, but the single sysadmin was not. Thus,
          I couldn't do anything that day. And no one seemed to have any issue with
          me not doing anything that day. However, I obviously was not allowed to go
          home early.
        </p>

        <h2>Borderline Absurd</h2>

        <p>
          Like many offices in the US, you had to tap your ID onto a reader in order to
          enter your building. However, here you also had to tap in order to enter your
          <i>floor</i>. I couldn't visit my friend on the 6th floor, and he couldn't
          visit me on the 7th. Even more absurdly, you had to tap to <i>exit</i> the
          building, and the ID system had internal state of where it thought you were.
          So, if you tap to exit a building, realize your shoe is untied, tie your shoe,
          and let the door close, you can no longer exit the building. Twice I had to
          tailgate someone to <i>exit</i> my building.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another bizarre thing, was that everyone had <i>two</i> desktops. One was Windows
          and one was Ubuntu. The Windows one was for email and PowerPoint, and the Ubuntu
          one for software development. How this made any sense was beyond me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meetings would go on for hours without discussing anything. I was so confused.
          The meetings I was a part of would always start on time but would never end on time.
        </p>

        <h2>The Destroyer</h2>

        <p>
          There was no version control. None. The code was emailed around. During my last
          week, a coworker gave a presentation on <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. My boss said he didn't understand
          the utility behind it.
        </p>

        <p>
          On my last day, I had to email my boss a zip file of my project. However, my project
          was on my Ubuntu desktop, but only the Windows one could send emails. I couldn't use
          a USB because the ports are blocked by stickers. How I did it, I don't remember.
        </p>

        <h1>Some Good Stuff</h1>

        <p>
          There were things that I was pleased to discover while working there though. One
          was that every Friday, everyone (the entire floor) would spend 20 minutes cleaning
          up. Things like taking out the trash, vacuuming, wiping the desks. This was really
          cool to see.
        </p>

        <p>
          I really liked the dorm food. There was a kitchen on the bottom floor that would
          serve breakfast on the weekdays. While would be a different meal every day, they
          always had some kind of miso. Oh and no phones were allowed in the dorm cafeteria.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, of course the country was beautiful. I wish I had travelled more but the
          commute burned me out a bit. I'll be back.

        <p class="note">
          I want to make it clear that I was, and still am, extremely grateful for the
          opportunity to have worked in Japan. It's an experience I don't think I'll
          ever have again.
