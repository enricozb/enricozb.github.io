          This was originally written around August 17th, 2018, in a stream of consciousness
          manner, on my last day in the office.

          I had the chance of working in Japan for the summer of 2018. It was a pretty
          interesting experience altogether but GARBAGE otherwise. I don't understand how
          these people come into work. I truly don't. I'm looking around the office right
          now and some people seem interested in what they're doing, but a lot of them
          just seem to stare into space with a face of hopelessness. A face of just,
          waiting out their existence. WTF.
        </p>

          This company is run as if every employee (including software engineers, HR,
          etc) is working at the factory. Mitsubishi doesn't have real IT I think. They could have yubikeys, a network
          which distributes software remotely, and disconnects offending machines
          remotely.

          Things I have problems with:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Work culture:
              <ul>
                <li>No music</li>
                <li>Everything is gray</li>
                <li>
                  Punctuality to an infinite degree. That is, I think if I worked twice as
                  fast as the guy next to me, but showed up 30 minutes late every day, I
                  would be fired.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The perception of doing things for safety/security purposes.
                  (I'm not sure if this is a mistranslation of "safety" but things under this
                  umbrella category are frequent)
                  <ul>
                    <li>We are required to wear our <i>soft</i> hats when walking outside.</li>
                    <li>
                      Several websites are blocked. <a href="https://pypi.org">pypi.org</a>
                      a lot of <a href="https://github.com">github</a> to name some of the more
                      useful websites.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      They use Windows:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Comes preinstalled with secure non-bloatware goodies like Minecraft,
                          Candy Crush, Royal Revolt, etc.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      I have 2 PC's... One for "research", and one for "office automation"
                      with Outlook, PowerPoint, etc. The research one isn't connected to the
                      Mitsubishi network, so for me to check my emails, I have to
                      physically move to the other computer. However, I have full 100%
                      access to the regular internet using the "research" one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The "research" one has triple monitors with a driving simulator.
                    </li>

                    <li>I also have a raspberry Pi</li>
                    <li>
                      I don't have admin rights to my windows computer.
                      (I had to get permission to install Chrome, Sublime Text, etc)
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          One time, I was needed to install some software to flash a piece
                          of hardware. The entire hierarchy of bosses were at work, but the
                          single sysadmin was not. Thus, I couldn't do anything that day.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      They don't allow any USB's on campus or on any computers
                      <ul>
                        <li>They give stickers to put over the USB ports</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      The guards will chase you down if you're seen walking with your phone
                      out or have any earphones in.
                      <ul>
                        <li>It's a safety violation.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      From the safety manual:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          "It is not improbable that a colleague in the workplace may suddenly
                          die, leaving permanent scars on family member and the workplace."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          "Unsafe Behavior: Example No. 10: Do not work long hours while
                          sitting with your legs crossed... Your legs may fall asleep, and if
                          you force yourself to walk under such condition, you may fall."
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      From the Security manual:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          They seem to have a list of prohibited software. It includes Winny, a
                          P2P file-sharing application that seems to be last updated 14 years
                          ago. Probably common JP software
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          "when discarding purchased items, destroy the item physically with a
                          hammer."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          a lot of this can be mitigated by switching over to using servers.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              Work environment:
              <ul>
                <li>Uniforms are required.</li>
                <li>Stretches at 3 pm .-.</li>
                <li>
                  The badges that give you access to the building allow you to badge in/out
                  only once! So if you badge out but stay in the building, you can't badge
                  out again. You'll get stuck in the building...
                </li>
                <li>
                  They seem to have meetings that last _ages_ but discuss nothing? I've
                  never seen any code put up during any of the meetings. Always just
                  diagrams and spreadsheets. And they take forever
                </li>
                <li>
                  THEY DON'T USE ANY VERSION CONTROL.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      While I was here a random employee gave a presentation on how to use
                      git & github, and the advantages of it. My boss said he didn't like it.
                      What in the world is going on here. They send code via email. I have to
                      give my code to my boss today, it's my last day, and I'm curious how
                      I'm going to do it because
                      <ul>
                        <li>I can't use USB</li>
                        <li>
                          My PC isn't connected to the Mitsubishi network, so I can't send it
                          over email.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Things I think are good:
          <ul>
            <li>
              All employees help when cleaning. Some vacuum, some take out the trash,
              some put new trash bags in, some clean the whiteboards, etc. Everyone helps
              out.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          The worst part is that the country is pretty nice. It would have been fun to
          go traveling more, but work just burned me out. 1.5 hour commute <i>each way</i>
          and having to report to the company from 8:30am - 5:00pm was just too much.
          My lord.
