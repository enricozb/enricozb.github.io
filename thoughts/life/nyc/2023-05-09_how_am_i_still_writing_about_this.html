          So many of my past journal entries contain the exact same feeling as the one I'm trying
          to convey right now. I'm not sure what I thought was going to happen. I thought unemployment
          would sort of figure itself out. Or that I would figure out a way to be perpetually
          unemployed, while still being financially responsible. I'm a little ashamed of picking up
          part-time jobs; it feels like regressing back to something comfortable.

          I waste too much time on my phone. It doesn't feel like an addiction. I don't mind leaving
          my phone at home if I go for a walk, but it's mere nearby presence distracts me. I don't
          even know if "distracts" is the right word. Notifications are all off, but my mind habitually
          thinks of it, and my body zombily opens up the same pages every time. I like having music
          on the go, but not at this cost.

          I am also extremely surprised to not feel the <i>drive</i> that I felt while I was working. When
          employed I would constantly think about how much I would build if I just had more free time.
          I would say to myself that programming 8 hours a day for work would leave me with no more
          energy to program for myself. But now I have so much time, and so much of it is being wasted,
          by me.

          I don't like this city. I don't like how it makes me feel. Trapped.
