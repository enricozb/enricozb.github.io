          Do you ever feel like you have a hard time thinking. Like, even when just spacing
          out, do you ever have a hard time making a concrete chain of thought, and getting
          past that initial protothought that poofed into existence? I'm honestly surprised I
          was able to think these sentences this far before writing them down on the page. For
          the past few weeks or months, I've noticed more and more that I feel like I'm having
          writer's block, but I'm not even a writer. I feel like I'm not doing any thinking
          of any kind. I'm watching the days go by in a way I have never done before, and in
          a way that I never thought I would do.
        </p>

          Ignorance is bliss, but only when you're not aware of it. I need some meta-ignorance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I feel useless and lost. I don't really see myself being a part of something large. I
          don't see myself building anything. I feel like my days aren't compounding. I don't
          know what I'm doing, and I'm not sure if that's a problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          I feel like I'm writing this a substitute for feeling like I've done something today.
