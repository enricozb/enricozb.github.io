          Somewhere in my senior year of high school, two friends and I were
          wondering how one could write <code>min(x,y)</code> in math
          notation using only binary operations and elementary functions. It took
          us a little while to come up with something, but eventually we got this:

          $$ \min(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{2} - \frac{\lvert x - y \rvert}{2} $$

          This first part of this function finds the midpoint between $x$ and $y$.
          Then, we travel half the distance between $x$ and $y$ toward $-\infty$, thus
          arriving at the smaller of the two numbers. It's pretty clear that
          <code>max(x,y)</code> can be achieved by travelling toward
          $+\infty$ instead of toward $-\infty$, like so:

          $$ \max(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{2} + \frac{\lvert x - y \rvert}{2} $$

          Curious to perform this "mathematical translation" on other functions commonly
          used in programing, we wondered how this could be done for equality,
          <code>x == y</code>. Since we wanted to stick to functions on the reals, we
          opted for <code>true</code> being $1$, and <code>false</code> being $0$.
          Here's what one of us came up with:

          $$ \text{eq}(x, y) = 1 - \left\lceil \frac{\lvert x - y \rvert}{\lvert x - y \rvert + 1} \right\rceil $$

          Using the ceiling function might seem like "cheating", but it's important to
          remember that we were mostly trying to sidestep functions defined in a
          piecewise/pattern-matching fashion. Thus, this one-line arithmetic
          definition met our needs.
        </p>

       <p>
          We kept going. Another useful function is <code>sign(x)</code>,
          also known as <code>signum(x)</code>, that returns $-1$ if $x$ is
          negative, $1$ if $x$ is positive, and $0$ if $x$ is $0$. Here's what we
          came up with:

          $$ \text{sign}(x) = \left\lfloor \frac{x}{\lvert x \rvert + 1} \right\rfloor +
              \left\lceil \frac{x}{\lvert x \rvert + 1} \right\rceil $$

          Now, what's the point of doing all of this? Well, for me it was the fact
          that in programming, arguments to a function (even as numbers) are
          data, stored sequentially in memory. This mindset allows for easier
          conceptualization of some operations over others. For example, how would
          you write some code to reverse a number? Well, if the number was stored
          in base 10 in memory, and not in binary, you could just copy the data
          but in reverse order. Now, as a preview of what is to come,
          <strong>how would you write a math function to reverse an integer?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was first working on this stuff, the idea of treating math
          functions in this way was pretty foreign and made me very curious about
          what was possible. Control flow, time and space complexity, a sequence
          of instructions, all of that was gone when writing using just arithmetic
          operations. In math, things just <i>are</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I understand now that this really isn't any ground-breaking math nor
          does it connect two fields in any novel way, but it was what I <em>thought</em>
          was math, and that's what made me thoroughly enjoy the journey. I hope
          you enjoy it too.
