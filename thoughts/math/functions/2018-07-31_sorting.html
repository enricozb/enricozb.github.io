        <h1>Relations &amp; Notation</h1>

        <p>
          Before getting too deep into how sorting works, I'm going to introduce
          some new functions and convenience notation first. In the
          <a href="./2018-07-17_introduction.html">first post</a> in this series, we talked
          about $\text{eq}$, which is a relation. A relation can be defined for
          our needs as a function of two arguments that always evaluates to either
          $0$ or $1$. That is, it is a function $f$ with the type signature

          $$ f : \mathbb{R} \to \{0, 1\} $$

          Other common relations can be defined as follows:

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              \text{lt}(x, y) &= \text{eq}(-1, \text{sign}(x - y)) \\
              \text{gt}(x, y) &= \text{eq}(1, \text{sign}(x - y)) \\
              \text{leq}(x, y) &= 1 - \text{gt}(x, y) \\
              \text{geq}(x, y) &= 1 - \text{lt}(x, y)
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          where the equations are <code>x &lt; y</code>, <code>x &gt; y</code>, <code>x &lt;= y</code>, and <code>x &gt;= y</code>, respectively.
          "Calling" these relations each time get cumbersome, so we will be using a
          notation inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iverson_bracket">Iverson Bracket</a>
          for convenience. Instead of writing $\text{lt}(x, y)$, we will
          write $[x &lt; y]$. This extends to the other relations defined above.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Note: We will only use
          the Iverson bracket with comparison operators whose functions have been previously
          defined, so that we are always using only binary &amp; elementary operations
          "under the hood".
        </p>

        <h1>Sorting</h1>
        <h2>What do we mean by sorting?</h2>
        <p>
          Since the primary "data" that we are working with are
          integers, a sorting function would be one that sorts the digits within
          an integer. For example,
          $$ \text{sort}_{10}(31524_{10}) = 54321_{10} $$
          The reason we sort in "decreasing" order is twofold:
          Since the digit at index $i = 0$ is the rightmost digit, sorting in this
          direction would mean that iterating from $i = 0$ to
          $\text{len}_b(x) - 1$ would traverse the digits in increasing order.
          Furthermore, we sort in this order to preserve $0$'s. If we
          sorted in the other direction, $1001$ and $101$ would look the same when
          sorted in base $10$, which is not a desirable quality.
        </p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          Sorting follows pretty naturally after reversing. Reversing is simply
          taking every digit of a number and placing it at a new index. Sorting
          is the exact same thing, except that the function that decides the new
          indices is different. That is,

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              \text{sort}_b(x) =
              \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{len}_b(x) - 1} \text{at}_b(x, i) \cdot b^{\sigma(x, i, b)}
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          where $\sigma(x, i, b)$ returns the new index of the digit at index $i$ of
          $x$ in base $b$. Notice this is exactly $\text{rev}$ when

          $$\sigma_{rev}(x, i, b) = \text{len}_b(x) - i - 1$$

          Now, what would $\sigma_{sort}(x, i, b)$ be? A reasonable guess for
          would be the number of digits in $x$ less than $\text{at}(x, i, b)$.
          That is,

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              \sigma_{sort}(x, i, b) = \sum_{j = 0}^{\text{len}_b(x) - 1} [\text{at}_b(x, j) &lt; \text{at}_b(x, i)]
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          However, this doesn't work for numbers with duplicate digits, as this would
          send both instances of the digit $3$ in the number $1233$ to the same index.
        </p>

        <p>
          What we ended up coming up with was this: $\sigma_{sort}$ would be the
          number of digits in $x$ strictly less than $\text{at}_b(x, i)$
          <em>plus</em> the number of instances of the digit $\text{at}_b(x, i)$ at
          indices less than $i$. That is,

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              \sigma_{eq}(x, i, b) &= \sum_{j = 0}^{i - 1} [\text{at}_b(x, j) = \text{at}_b(x, i)] \\
              \sigma_{lt}(x, i, b) &= \sum_{j = 0}^{\text{len}_b(x) - 1} [\text{at}_b(x, j) &lt; \text{at}_b(x, i)] \\
              \sigma_{sort}(x, i, b) &= \sigma_{eq}(x, i, b) + \sigma_{lt}(x, i, b)
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          Now we can define $\text{sort}$ as,

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              \text{sort}_b(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{len}_b(x) - 1} \text{at}_b(x, i) \cdot b^{{\sigma_{sort}}(x, i, b)}
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          An interesting side note here is that, in some sense, this sort is
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517793/what-is-stability-in-sorting-algorithms-and-why-is-it-important">stable</a>.
          Obviously integers that are equal are fungible
          . Every $1$
          is the same as every other $1$ in the pool of integers $\mathbb{Z}$.
          If digits did have some sort of identity, as they do in computers,
          then this sorting function would be considered stable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similar to what we did in <a href="./2018-07-17_reverse.html.html">a previous post</a>
          we can convert this definition to code. Here's an example in Python,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          from math import *<br>
          <br>
          def len(x, b):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return ceil(log(x + 1, b))<br>
          <br>
          def at(x, i, b):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return floor(abs(x) / (b ** i)) % b<br>
          <br>
          def sign(x):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return floor(x / (abs(x) + 1)) + ceil(x / (abs(x) + 1))<br>
          <br>
          def eq(x, y):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return 1 - ceil(abs(x - y) / (abs(x - y) + 1))<br>
          <br>
          def lt(x, y):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return eq(-1, sign(x - y))<br>
          <br>
          def sigma_eq(x, i, b):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return sum(eq(at(x, j, b), at(x, i, b)) for j in range(0, i))<br>
          <br>
          def sigma_lt(x, i, b):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return sum(lt(at(x, j, b), at(x, i, b)) for j in range(0, len(x, b)))<br>
          <br>
          def sigma_sort(x, i, b):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return sigma_eq(x, i, b) + sigma_lt(x, i, b)<br>
          <br>
          def sort(x, b):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return sum(at(x, i, b) * b ** sigma_sort(x, i, b)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for i in range(len(x, b)))<br>
        </div>

        <p>And again let's test it out to see if it works:</p>

        <div class="code">
          >>> sort(18081971, 10)<br>
          98871110<br>
          >>> sort(0o1420740, 8) == 0o7442100<br>
          True<br>
          >>> sort(0xcafebabe, 16) == 0xfeecbbaa<br>
          True<br>
        </div>

        <p>
          Sweet! Looks like we can sort integers now. <a href="./2018-09-18_look-and-say.html">Next</a>
          we'll talk about making a Look and Say function $L(x)$, that takes in an
          integer $x$ and outputs the next term in the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence">Look and Say</a> sequence.
