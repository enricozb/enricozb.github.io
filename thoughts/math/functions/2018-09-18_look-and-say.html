        <h1>The Sequence</h1>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence">Look &amp; Say sequence</a>
          was originally introduced and analyzed by John Conway. The sequence begins
          as follows:

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, \dots
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read
          the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups
          of the same digit. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>$1$ is read as "one $1$" or $11$.</li>
          <li>$11$ is read as "two $1$s" or $21$.</li>
          <li>$21$ is read as "one $2$, one $1$" or $1211$.</li>
          <li>$1211$ is read as "one $1$, one $2$, two $1$s" or $111221$.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Notice you can start with a different "seed" or starting number. This
          leads to a different sequence. Interestingly enough, $22$ is the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence#Growth">only</a>
          seed that leads to a sequence that loops. All other seeds generate a
          sequence that grows indefinitely.
        </p>

        <h1>The Function Definition</h1>
        <p>
          How would you make <i>this</i> into a function using only the constructs we've
          introduced? This post will be longer than usual because of the many parts
          required to complete this task. It's not that daunting, but it's going to
          take a bit of explaining on my part.
        </p>

        <p>
          The function we want to create will take in an integer $x$ and output the
          next term in the sequence. For example, using the values we computed
          in the section above, we would have the following input/output pairs:

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              L(1) &= 11 \\
              L(11) &= 21 \\
              L(21) &= 1211 \\
              L(1211) &= 111221 \\
              &\vdots
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          The function could also take any positive integer, and not just those from
          the most common sequence. For example,

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              L(6) &= 16 \\
              L(73) &= 1713 \\
              L(4444) &= 44 \\
              &\vdots
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          This is the function we want to write out. Let's start off with some
          intuition first to get our feet wet.
        </p>

        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <h2>Grouping</h2>

        <p>
          When visually computing the next Look &amp; Say number, we group consecutive
          similar digits together. For example, we would group the digits of the
          number $11244$ as $[11][2][44]$. Then we use the contents of each group
          to generate the next term. This "grouping" action can be done numerically
          by computing a number that encodes where these groups start and end. One
          way to do this is to create a number that has $1$s on the boundaries of
          groups and $0$s otherwise. For example, using the number $11244$ again,
          we would have

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              11244 \to {_11_01_12_14_04_1} \to 101101
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          This is equivalent to placing $1$s between digits that differ and
          $0$s between digits that are the same. Finally pad this number with $1$s
          on the left and right side of the entire integer. Here's how we can do this:

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              G_{inner}(x) &=
              \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{len}(x) - 2} [\text{at}(x, i) \ne \text{at}(x, i + 1)] \cdot 10^i \\
              G(x) &= 1 + 10^{\text{len}(x)} + G_{inner}(x) \cdot 10
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          <i>
            Note: I've omitted the base $b$ subscript found in $\text{len}_b(x)$ as
            it's assumed to be $10$. This will be done throughout the rest of this post.
          </i>
        </p>

        <p>
          The keen eye will notice that we haven't defined $\text{neq}$ yet, and
          therefore should not be able to use $\neq$, but, it's easily defined
          as

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              \text{neq}(x, y) = 1 - \text{eq}(x, y)
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          The way $G$ works is $G_{inner}$ goes through each adjacent pair of digits
          in $x$ and "concatenates" a $1$ if they're different and a $0$ otherwise.
          Notice this doesn't take into account the $1$s that should be at the
          beginning and the end of this grouping number. To take care of this, $G$
          shifts $G_{inner}$ over by one digit, and adds a $1$ at the start and end.
          These manipulations are easier to think about in terms of string operations,
          instead of literally adding numerals.
        </p>

        <h2>Counting Groups</h2>
        <h3>Intuition</h3>

        <p>
          The next big step is to iterate over these groups and build up the next
          Look &amp; Say number. A sentence description of what needs to happen would be
          something like: For each $1$ in $G(x)$ (from right to left) at index $i$,
          let $j$ be the index of the next $1$ in $G(x)$ after the one at index $i$,
          then $at(x, i)$ is the digit that occured $j - i$ times in $x$. If we
          concatenate these instances of $j - i$ and $at(x, i)$ for each group in
          $G(x)$, we'll have the next number.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we remember from <a href="./2018-07-31_sorting.html">previous post</a>, concatenation is hard
          because when concatenating $x$ to $y$, we need to know the length of $y$. This
          is difficult if you're building up a number via concatenation. In the sorting
          case this was easy because each iteration of the loop we would add only one
          digit. Here we may add a variable number of digits since $j - i$ could be <i>any</i>
          positive integer. Thus, we need a function to count the length of the Look &amp;
          Say number we have built <i>so far</i>, up until group $i$, so that we can
          concatenate properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some useful things to notice are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The number of $1$s in $G(x)$ is one greater than the number of groups of digits in $x$.
          </li>
          <li>
            The number of $0$s in between two $1$s in $G(x)$ is one less than the number of digits in that group.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a group bounded by $1$s at indices $i, j$ where $i &lt; j$, the length that group
            contributes to the next Look &amp; Say number is $\text{len}(j - i) + 1$.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Formalizing</h2>

        <p>
          When iterating through $G(x)$, we only really care about performing operations
          where the $1$s are. Thus, we can start off with

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              L(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{len}(G(x)) - 2} at(G(x), i) \cdot [\dots]
            \end{aligned}
          $$
          <i>
            Note: The upper bound of the sum is subtracted by $2$ because the last
            $1$ in $G(x)$ is not the start boundary of a group, but instead and the end.
          </i>
        </p>

        <p>
          The $[\dots]$ represents stuff we still need to write. The
          $\text{at}(G(x), i)$ serves as discarding the computations in $[\dots]$ when
          the digit at index $i$ is $0$.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, as we said in the previous section, we need to find the index of the next
          $1$, use that to compute the length of the group, and then concatenate that
          length and the corresponding digit in $x$ to our ongoing computation. If
          $G_{len}(x, i)$ is the length of the group at index $i$ and $\sigma(x, i)$ is
          new index of the group length &amp; digit pair, then we have

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              \sigma(x, i) &= [\dots] \\
              G_{len}(x, i) &= [\dots] \\
              L_{pair}(x, i) &= G_{len}(x, i) \cdot 10 + \text{at}(x, i) \\
              L(x) &= \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{len}(G(x)) - 1} \text{at}(G(x), i) \cdot L_{pair}(x, i) \cdot 10^{\sigma(x, i)}
            \end{aligned}
          $$
        </p>

        <h2>Tackling $\sigma$</h2>

        <p>
          I think $\sigma(x, i)$ is pretty easy assuming we already have $G_{len}$. It's
          essentially the number of digits that have been concatenated already. Thus,
          it's the sum of all of the <i>lengths</i> of $L_{pair}$s for indices less than $i$,
          since that's what we're concatenating together. Thus, we would write this as

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              \sigma(x, i) = \sum_{j = 0}^{i - 1} at(G(x), j) \cdot (\text{len}(L_{pair}(x, j)))
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          <i>Note: again, we don't care about indices where $G(x)$ is $0$.</i>
        </p>

        <h2>Tackling $G_{len}$</h2>

        <p>
          $G_{len}(x, i)$ is simply the length of the group at index $i$ in $x$. So we
          know the first $1$ is at index $i$. Then we need to find the index of the next
          $1$. Here's an example $G(x)$ with $i, j$ indicated when $i = 2$:

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              G(22344455) &\to {_12_02_13_14_04_04_15_05_1} \to 101100101 \\
              G(x) &= 101\underset{j}{1}00\underset{i}{1}01 \\
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          The number we care about is $j - i$, since that is equal to the length of the
          group. We would expect, in this case, that $G_{len}(22344455, 2) = 3$, since
          the group of $4$s is of length $3$. One way to compute $j - i$ is to truncate
          the digits at indices before and including $i$ in $G(x)$, then take the length
          of the reverse of the resulting number and subtract it from the length of the
          truncation before the reversal and add $1$. Here's a diagram that's hopefully
          more understandable:

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              [10&1\underset{j}{1}00]\underset{i}{1}01 \\
              &\downarrow \text{truncate} \\
              a = 10&1100 \\
              &\downarrow \text{reverse} \\
              b = 11&01 \\
              &\downarrow \text{compute} \\
              1 + \text{len}(a) &- \text{len}(b) = 3
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          We would write that like this:

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              G_{tr}(x, i) &= \left\lfloor \frac{G(x)}{10^{i + 1}} \right\rfloor \\
              G_{len}(x, i) &= 1 + \text{len}(G_{tr}(x, i)) - \text{len}(\text{rev}(G_{tr}(x, i)))
            \end{aligned}
          $$
        </p>

        <h2>Recap</h2>

        <p>
          Let's just rewrite all of the functions here for convenience

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              G_{inner}(x) &= \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{len}(x) - 2}
                [\text{at}(x, i) \ne \text{at}(x, i + 1)] \cdot 10^i \\
              G(x) &= 1 + 10^{\text{len}(x)} + G_{inner}(x) \cdot 10 \\
              \sigma(x, i) &= \sum_{j = 0}^{i - 1} at(G(x), j) \cdot (G_{len}(x, j) + 1) \\
              G_{tr}(x, i) &= \left\lfloor \frac{G(x)}{10^{i + 1}} \right\rfloor \\
              G_{len}(x, i) &= 1 + \text{len}(G_{tr}(x, i)) -
                            \text{len}(\text{rev}(G_{tr}(x, i))) \\
              L_{pair}(x, i) &= G_{len}(x, i) \cdot 10 + \text{at}(x, i) \\
              L(x) &= \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{len}(G(x)) - 1} \text{at}(G(x), i) \cdot
                L_{pair}(x, i) \cdot 10^{\sigma(x, i)}
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          Heck yea it works! Isn't that crazy? What's even cooler is looking at some $x$

          Hmmm... Well, I guess that makes sense right? We could interpret this as there
          being no $0$s, hence we'd expect $L(0) = 00 = 0$. Fair enough.

          Ah, this is because $\text{len}$ relies on $\log$, whose domain is only the
          positive reals. $\text{len}(0) = 0$, but is undefined for any smaller integer.
          No real way around that I think.

        <div class="code">
          >>> L(211111111113)<br>
          1210113<br>
        </div>

        <p>
          Notice this handles groups of length greater than $9$ just fine. As we'd
          hopefully expect, $L(21111111113)$ results in reading "one $2$, ten $1$s,
          and one $3$", which is the output we get. (This is just me showing off).

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <p>
          This was a pretty fun "adventure" to go on as a high schooler. I previously saw
          the Look &amp; Say numberphile video and was so intrigued by the sequence. When I
          came up with this I thought I could be on the show, but of course I was (and
          still am) just a kid. It took me about 2-3 weeks to come up with this and make
          sure it actually worked.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not sure how much further we can go with this. I was thinking if it's possible
          to make a function $L_{idx}(s, i)$ that can take a seed $s$ and an index $i$
          without using the super-function notation. That is, this could be written as

          $$
            \begin{aligned}
              L_{idx}(s, i) = L^{(i)}(s)
            \end{aligned}
          $$

          but I was wondering if there was a way to do this without introducing any new
          notation. I haven't come up with anything yet though.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the next (and likely last) functions post, we'll talk about stuff I haven't
          figured out yet and maybe gloss over the other interesting functions I haven't
          yet mentioned.
