        <h1> Forms </h1>

        <p>
          It's important to note that in idk-lang, every syntactically valid
          construct is known as a <i>form</i>. There are two types of forms,
          there are <i>statements</i> and there are <i>expressions</i>. Statements
          do not return a value. Expressions return a value.
        </p>

        <h2>Assignment &amp; Blocks</h2>

        <p>
          Assignment comes in two flavors: a single-line assignment statement and
          a multiline assignment statement. Single-line assignment statements
          are (unsurprisingly) assignment occuring entirely on a single line.
          Multiline assignment statements must be started by a newline, and
          indented some amount of spaces to form a <i>block</i>. The last line
          of the block must be an expression and that value is what will be used
          for the assignment. Here are two valid assignment statements
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          x: 1          # `x` will be assigned `1`

          y_plus_z:     # `y_plus_z` will be assigned `3`
            y: 1        # `y` will be assigned `1`
            z: 2        # `z` will be assigned `2`
            y + z       # `y + z` returns `3`
        </div>

        <p>
          Assignment is a statement, and thus cannot be used as a value. For
          example, <code>1 + (x: 1)</code> would be a syntax error because
          <code>x: 1</code> does not return a value.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, in an attempt to have unified syntax, wherever a colon <code>:</code>
          is syntactically valid, it can be followed by a single-line form or a
          multiline list of forms. A multiline list of forms is known as a <i>block</i>
          and must be indented with some amount of tabs or spaces (but not both!).
        </p>

        <h2> Expression Forms </h2>

        <p>
          The following forms (<code>if</code>, <code>when</code>, and
          <code>match</code>) are all expressions. Therefore, they can be used on
          the right-hand side of a single-line assignment and as the expression in
          the last line of the block of an assignment.
        </p>

        <h2> If Expression </h2>

        <p>
          The general syntax for <code>if</code> expressions look like
          this, (very similar to Python's syntax)
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          if a_boolean:
            return_value_if_true
          else:
            return_value_if_false
        </div>

        <p>
          Remember, since <code>if</code> is an expression, it returns a value. The
          last value in the <code>if</code> or <code>else</code> block is what is
          returned. For example,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          if x >= 0:
            x
          else:
            negative_x: -x
            negative_x
        </div>

        <p>
          This expression (rather verbosely) evaluates to the absolute value of
          <code>x</code>.
        </p>

        <h2> When Expression </h2>

        <p>
          <code>when</code> expressions are a generalized version of <code>if</code>
          expressions. They can take a list of boolean expressions and code to
          execute. It's easier to explain with an example,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          when:
            x = y: "equal"
            abs(x - y) &lt; 1: "close"
            else: "far"
        </div>

        <p>
          This mostly reads like english: <i>When x and y are equal: return
          "equal". When the absolute value of their difference is less than one:
          return "close". Otherwise: return "far"</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice, the first true boolean that is ecountered is the one whose branch
          will be executed. For example,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          when:
            True: "which"
            True: "branch"
            True: "will"
            True: "execute"
            True: "first?"
        </div>

        <p>
          will return <code>"which"</code>.
        </p>

        <h2> Parameterized When Expression </h2>

        <p>
          <code>when</code> expressions are more than just multiple if expressions,
          they can also pass paremeters to functions for a more expressive piece
          of code.  For example,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          when x, y:
            (&lt;): "less than"
            (&gt;): "greater than"
            (=): "equal"
        </div>

        <p>
          Here, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are passed to the functions in each
          branch, until one evaluates to <code>True</code>. If a <code>when</code>
          expression is missing an <code>else</code> branch, the compiler will
          complain if it can't figure out that the <code>when</code> expression is
          exhaustive. That is, if the compiler can't tell that at least one of the
          branches of the <code>when</code> expression will return <code>True</code>,
          it will raise a compilation error.
        </p>

        <p>
          Parameterized <code>when</code> expressions can take any number of
          parameters. Here's one with one parameter using operator sections that
          evaluates to the sign of <code>x</code>
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          when x:
            (&lt; 0): -1
            (= 0): 0
            (&gt; 0): 1
        </div>

        <h2> Match Expressions </h2>

        <p>
          The last expression form is a <code>match</code> expression.  It's similar
          to the pattern matching facilities in other languages, but maybe slightly
          more advanced. A <code>match</code> expression is made up of a value
          and several patterns to test the value against.  Here's an example match
          statement that computes the boolean expression <code>x or y</code>,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          match x, y:
            (_, True): True
            (True, _): True
            else: False
        </div>

        <p>
          Here, the <code>match</code> expression tests the tuple <code>x, y</code>
          against possible patterns. The underscore <code>_</code>, or any other
          variable name for that matter, matches against any object. Thus, the pattern
          <code>(_, True)</code> matches against all 2-tuples that have their second
          element as <code>True</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>match</code> expressions also have <i>disjunctive patterns</i>
          meaning that multiple patterns can be matched in one branch. For example,
          this expression returns <code>True</code> is one of the elements is
          <code>0</code>,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          match x, y:
            (_, 0) or (0, _): True
            else: False
        </div>

        <p>
          <code>match</code> expressions also have <code>if</code> and
          <code>when</code> guards. These are useful for finer grained logic against
          matched values. For example, let's say we have a tuple <code>person</code>
          with type <code>(String, Int)</code> representing the name and age of an
          individual. Then we can have the following <code>match</code> expression.
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          match person:
            (name, age) if age &lt; 20: f"{name} is a teenager"
            (name, age) if age &lt; 75: f"{name} is an adult"
            (name, age): f"{name} is a senior"
        </div>

        <p>
          As you can hopefully see, <code>if</code> guards are pretty useful. However,
          as you can also hopefully see, multiple if guards begin to get pretty
          verbose, even if they are doing conditionals on the same portion of the
          pattern. There has to be a better way! In the same way that you can use
          <code>when</code> expressions as multiple <code>if</code> expressions,
          you can use <code>when</code> <i>guards</i> as multiple <code>if</code>
          <i>guards</i>! Here's a cleaner version of the code above,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          match person:
            (name, age) when age:
              (&lt; 20): f"{name} is a teenager"
              (&lt; 75): f"{name} is an adult"
              else: f"{name} is a senior"
        </div>

        <p>
          <i>Note</i>: the <code>when</code> <i>guards</i> need not be exhaustive. If
          a <code>when</code> guard fails to find a branch that evaluates to
          <code>True</code>, the entire pattern matching branch fails and moves
          onto the next branch. Because of this, the <code>else</code> clause in the
          example above could be on either the <code>when</code> guard block or as
          the final clause in the <code>match</code> expression.
        </p>

        <p>
          The last feature of <code>match</code> expressions is being
          able to have multiple instances of the same variable in one pattern.
          Here's an example of a <code>match</code> expression that
          evaluates to <code>True</code> if the 2-tuple
          <code>tup</code> contains two elements that are equal to
          eachother,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          match tup:
            (x, x): True
            else: False
        </div>

        <p>
          This is exactly euivalent to
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          match tup:
            (x, y) if x = y: True
            else: False
        </div>

        <p>
          Thus the additional constraints on <code>tup</code> having two elements that
          are of the same type and that inherit from <code>Equatable</code> will apply.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next section will be on loops and lambdas.
