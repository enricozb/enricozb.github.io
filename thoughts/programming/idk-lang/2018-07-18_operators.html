        <h1> Let's see some code! </h1>

        <p>
          The code samples I've provided here are subject to not be valid in
          any future implementation of this language. I'm still trying to figure
          everything out, and it's hard to go back and change
          everywhere where I stated something about this language. So, I don't
          think things will change much, but they will be left here to preserve
          a record of progress, so I can see what this language really started
          out as.
        </p>

        <h2> Literals </h2>

        <p>
          Here's what the literals look like:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          1                    # Num
          2.0                  # Fractional
          3e4                  # Fractional
          5i                   # Complex
          True                 # Bool
          False                # Bool
          (1, True, "a")       # (Num, Bool, String)
          [1, 2, 3]            # [Num] or List&lt;Num&gt;
          {1, 2, 3}            # {Num} or Set&lt;Num&gt;
          {"a": 1 "b": 2}      # {String: Num} or Dict&lt;String, Num&gt;
          "Hello, World!"      # String
        </div>

        <p>
          Notice the types on the right of each literal expression.  <code>Num</code>,
          <code>Complex</code>, and <code>Fractional</code> are all traits. The
          type of these literals is similar to Haskell's typeclasses of the same
          name. They represent the most general type that this literal can be. We'll
          talk about traits in more detail in a later section. <code>Bool</code>
          is a type with two constructors that take no arguments, <code>True</code>
          and <code>False</code>.  <code>Lists</code> and <code>Sets</code> are
          heterogenous, that is, they only hold objects of the same type. Lastly,
          <code>String</code> is <i>not</i> a trait like <code>Num</code> and friends,
          it is a proper class. It can be instantiated, and cannot be inherited from,
          unlike traits. We'll talk about classes in more detail in a later section.
        </p>

        <h2> Binary Operators </h2>

        <p>
          Here are some basic operators:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          1 + 1     # 2
          1 - 1     # 0
          2 * 2     # 4
          1 / 2     # 0.5
          3 ^ 2     # 9
        </div>

        <p>
          Even though we haven't talked about idk-lang's type language yet, we
          will use it here for a quick showcase of some of the features of this
          language. The type of <code>+</code> is <code>Addable a =&gt; a -&gt;
          a -&gt; a</code>. That is, <code>+</code> takes in two objects of the
          same type <code>a</code> where the type <code>a</code> must inherit the
          trait <code>Addable</code>. Since <code>Num</code> and <code>String</code>
          both inherit <code>Addable</code>, the following expressions are both valid,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          10213674 + 7868297       # 18081971
          "Hello, " + "World!"     # "Hello, World!"
        </div>

        <p>
          This shows one of the many advantages to using traits in a statically
          typed environment. It prevents the creation of over-engineered
          syntax to handle the &ldquo;overloading&rdquo; of operators on different
          types.
        </p>

        <h2> Boolean Operators </h2>

        <p>
          Lastly, we have the boolean operators:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          not True         # False
          True and False   # False
          True or False    # True
        </div>

        <p>
          The operator <code>not</code> has type <code>Bool -&gt; Bool</code>.
          The operators <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> both have type
          <code>Bool -&gt; Bool -&gt; Bool</code>. These work as expected,
          and because of how strict this language is, there is never an implicit
          cast or coercion to any type, so these functions only work on booleans.
        </p>

        <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>

        <p>
          We've seen some basic binary operators: <code>+ - / * ^</code>. A valid
          type for all of these operators is <code>Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt;
          a</code>.  That is, they take in two objects of the same type <code>a</code>
          that implement the trait <code>Num</code>, and return an object of type
          <code>a</code> that also implements that <code>Num</code>. These are called
          <i>Numeric operators</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is another group of operators called <i>Comparison operators</i>.
          They all have type <code>a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>. That is, they take
          in two objects, both of type <code>a</code> and the and they return a
          <code>Bool</code>. Now, <code>a</code> are <i>type variables</i>, they
          represent any possible type.  For example, the following operators are
          <i>Comparison operators</i>
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          1 = 1     # True (structural equality)
          1 &lt; 2     # True
          1 &gt; 2     # False
          1 /= 1    # False
        </div>

        <p>
          What is special about these operators is that they can be chained for
          greater expressive power. For example, this is a valid use of these
          operators,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3      # True
          1 &lt; 2 &gt; 3      # False
          1 = 1 &lt; 3      # True
        </div>

        <p>
          These chains are equivalent to checking that every adjacent pair of
          arguments to each operator returns <ezb-code>True</ezb-code>. In the
          case of function calls inside chains, they are only executed once
          per chain.
        </p>

        <h2>Partial(ly applied) operators</h2>

        <p>
          Another cool feature of operators is that they can be partially
          applied, esentially equivalent to Haskell's
          <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Section_of_an_infix_operator">operator sections</a>
          except without any iterated section support. For example,
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          (&lt;0)   # A function that returns True if the input is less than 0
          (=1)   # A function that returns True if the input is equal to 1
          (2*)   # A function that multiplies its input by 2
        </div>

        <p>
          These can be really expressive when using maps or filters.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="./2018-07-18_forms.html">next section</a> is on <i>forms</i>,
          where we'll talk about assignment, <code>if</code> expressions, and
          <code>where</code> expressions.
