          <a href="https://github.com/enricozb/CS81-2019">Myth</a> is my attempt to
          realize some of the ideas I had in the currently incomplete series of
          <a href="https://ezb.io/thoughts/programming/idk_lang/idk_lang_1.html">idk-lang posts</a>.  I
          started this as a senior project with a professor while doing my undergrad at
          Caltech, and I'm going to try to blog out my progress here. Honestly, the lack
          of literature on languages that have both type-inference, polymorphism, and
          mutability, is the main reason I'm writing this. Hopefully someone will find
          something useful here.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's called Myth because I don't think it'll ever really exist how I want it
          to. What I want is probably too impractical to exist anyways, and I constantly
          keep going back and forth during language design when trying to add a feature
          and understand the tradeoffs of doing so.
        </p>

        <p>
          Myth is written in OCaml (until it maybe becomes self-hosted), so you'll
          probably want to brush up on the OCaml syntax before digging too deep here.

          We'll start off with <a href="./2019-03-15_lexer-and-parser.html">lexing/parsing</a>
          first. Lexing in particular is unfortunately a bit involved since I wanted a
          whitespace-sensitive language.
