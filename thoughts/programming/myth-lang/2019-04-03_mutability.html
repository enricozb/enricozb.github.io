        <h1>Hindley-Milner and Mutability</h1>

        <p>
          After implementing Hindley-Milner, I had type inference. It was good enough
          to start with, and I thought the next big stepping stone was mutability.
          Specifically, I wanted mutable bindings, but not necessarily mutable objects.
          Basically, I wanted something like this to work
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          def f(v):
            x = 0
            if v > 0:
              x = 1
            else:
              x = -1
            return x
        </div>

        <p>
          Obviously this can be written in a way without mutable bindings, but
          mutable bindings are often useful for global counters and other imperative
          structures. I also wanted to distinguish between assignments, bindings, and
          mutable bindings. So the syntax now looks like
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          def f(v):
            let y = 0
            let mut x = 0
            if v > 0:
              x = 1
            else:
              x = -1
            return [x, y]
        </div>

        <h2>Value Restriction</h2>

        <p>
          So, for inspiration, I decided to look at how OCaml implements it's mutable
          references, which is different than what I wanted, but is close enough.
          Specifically, OCaml has a <code>ref</code> function, which creates a mutable reference
          which can be <i>passed around</i>. What I wanted is not a reference that could
          be passed around, but bindings that could be rebound during the execution of
          the program. Either way, let's take a look at OCaml's type inference with calls
          to <code>ref</code>:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          >>> let x = ref [];;
              x : '_weak1 list ref = {contents = []}
        </div>

        <p>
          So we see here that <code>x</code> has the type
          <code>Ref[List[_weak1]]</code>. Basically, the type variable
          <code>_weak1</code> is a variable that can't be generalized. So when
          instantiating it, we get the same <code>_weak1</code> variable back. What
          OCaml implements is what is known as <i>the value restriction</i>. It's
          basically a modification of Hindley-Milner's <code>generalize</code>
          function. It generalizes only specific syntactical structures. Namely,
          it generalizes only the structures that are sure to not create a mutable
          reference. So what used to be simple calls to <code>generalize</code>
          are now replaced with
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          if mut || is_expansive ast then
            ty
          else
            generalize level ty
        </div>

        <p>
          where <code>mut</code> just tells us if the binding is mutable. At the very bottom of
          <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/html/book-ora026.html">this page</a>
          we can see a list of expressions considered expansive and non-expansive. This
          is what is computed by <code>is_expansive</code> in the code above. It just checks if
          an expression could potentially create a mutable binding:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
          let is_expansive = function
            | Ast.Name _
            | Ast.Num _
            | Ast.List _   (* TODO: change if List becomes mutable *)
            | Ast.Lambda _
            | Ast.Field _  (* TODO: change if mutable fields are added *)
            | Ast.Record _ (* TODO: change if mutable fields are added *)
              -> false

            | Ast.Call _ -> true
            | _ -> failwith "Type.is_expansive called on non-expression"
        </div>

        <p>
          As we can see, this has to be changed as changes are made to the language. For
          example, if I make the list object, <code>[]</code>, mutable, then we need to never
          generalize any use of the list constructor.
        </p>

        <h2>Relaxation</h2>

        <p>
          The value restriction is a bit pessimistic, specifically when returning
          polymorphic values from function calls. This can be resolved in most cases
          with a deceptively simple change to generalization described in
          <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-value_restriction-fiwflp04.pdf">this paper</a>.
          I have yet to implement this, but hopefully will soon.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll probably talk about recursive types next. I've added extensible records
          already at the time of this writing, but they're not as useful as I'd like
          them to be. Their use will dramatically increase with recursive typing,
          since I can have concepts such as <code>self</code>.
