      <p><a href="https://github.com/enricozb/CS81-2019">Myth</a> is my attempt to realize some of
      the ideas I had in the currently incomplete series of <a href="https://ezb.io/thoughts/programming/idk_lang/idk_lang_1.html">idk-lang
      posts</a>.  I
      started this as a senior project with a professor while doing my undergrad at
      Caltech, and I'm going to try to blog out my progress here. Honestly, the lack
      of literature on languages that have both type-inference, polymorphism, and
      mutability, is the main reason I'm writing this. Hopefully someone will find
      something useful here.</p>
      
      <p>It's called Myth because I don't think it'll ever really exist how I want it
      to. What I want is probably too impractical to exist anyways, and I constantly
      keep going back and forth during language design when trying to add a feature
      and understand the tradeoffs of doing so.</p>
      
      <p>Myth is written in OCaml (until it maybe becomes self-hosted), so you'll
      probably want to brush up on the OCaml syntax before digging too deep here.</p>
      
      <p>We'll start off with lexing/parsing first. Lexing in particular is
      unfortunately a bit involved since I wanted a whitespace-sensitive language.</p>
