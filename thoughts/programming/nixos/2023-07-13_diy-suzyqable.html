        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
          I've got one of these "old" Google Pixelbooks, specifically a 2017 Pixelbook Eve model
          with a Kaby Lake CPU. I want to install NixOS on it, and this will be the first of a
          few posts documenting my journey doing so.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are few challenges that I am immediately aware of:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>We need to remove Write Protection to install "real" linux</li>
          <li>Some hardware (like audio) will not work out of the box</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          In this post we'll tackle the first of those two.
        </p>

        <h1>Why we need a SuzyQable</h1>

        <p>
          In order to replace the stock boot firmware with UEFI, you need to disable write protection
          on an embedded controller called <code>cr50</code>. To do that you either need to remove the
          battery or use a <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/master/docs/ccd.md#SuzyQ-SuzyQable">
          SuzyQable</a>. Sparkfun <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/14746">used to sell these</a>
          but apparently no longer does, so I was forced to make a DIY verison. Luckily, the chromium
          team publishes <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/master/docs/ccd.md#making-your-own-suzyq">
          the schematics</a> of the cable.
        </p>

        <h1>The Breakout Board</h1>

        <p>
          I purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094QFDLXG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1">
          this USB-C breakout board</a> from Amazon, which is not one of the two common boards that there seems to be
          documentation on when making these SuzyQables. (Incidentally, this breakout board also came with a female
          breakout board, which ended up being invaluable in the debugging process of my incorrect wiring).
        </p>

        <p>
          So this page is more searchable: it's a <a href="https://flashtree.com/collections/all-products/products/00012">flashtree USB-C breakout board</a>.
        </p>

        <h1>Soldering the Connections</h1>
        <p>
          Using <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/master/docs/ccd.md#making-your-own-suzyq">
          the schematics</a> as a guide, here's what I did:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Connect A1, B1, B12, A12 together to BLACK (GND)
          </li>
          <li>
            Connect A4, A9, B4, B9 together to RED (+5v)
          </li>
          <li>
            Connect the 22k resistors across A4 and A8
          </li>
          <li>
            Connect the 56k resistors across B4 and B8
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
          Note: The last two points above are <b>not</b> what the schematics say. I had originally wired it exactly like the
          schematics said (resistors across VBUS and A5/B5) but this didn't work. After using the female board and checking
          connections it seems that this board behaves similarly to the "green board" in the comments in the youtube video
          (see <a href="#resources">resources</a> below).
        </p>

        <h2>Data Minus & Plus (Green & White)</h2>

        <p>
          I spent like an hour trying to understand which wire (green or white) is data minus and which is data plus. I looked
          online for various pinouts of USB-A cables, and different resources said different things. I'm not sure if it even
          matters if you swap green and white, but I just guessed this position and it worked. If my wiring doesn't work for you,
          your donor cable might be different, so try swapping green and white.
        </p>

        <h1>Removing Write Protect</h1>
        <p>
          There is a fantastic guide on on removing write protect on the <a href="https://github.com/yusefnapora/pixelbook-linux">
            yusefnapora/pixelbook-linux</a> GitHub repository, and I won't reproduce that here.
        </p>
